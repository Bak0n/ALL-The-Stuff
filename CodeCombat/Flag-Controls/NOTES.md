##FLAG CONTROLS V. 0.1.3 
######		Licensed under MIT

###ABOUT THE PROJECT
	The idea of Flag Controls was a code block that would be copied and pasted into any level and provide
an easy and simple way to beat levels. Currently, it has 2 functions, the second in an early state.

###HOW TO USE IT
	Flag Controls is simple, just
1. Enter real-time playback
2. Control your character using G and then clicking to guide your character to a location.
3. Attack by pressing B and clicking (it's best to click ON the character, not around or away from it, however it still works).
4. There will be a third function activated by pressing V, but I haven't even started on that. 
^	 Once I finish attack mode I'll begin on that.

###BEFORE USING THE CONTROLS
 - Flag Controls is written in JavaScript, if you haven't already, set your language to JavaScript it in settings.
 - Flag controls uses commands from the Flags item set, there are multiple ways to obtain this.
