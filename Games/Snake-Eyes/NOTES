    WHAT IS SNAKE EYES?
Snake Eyes is a game of chance in wich players roll dice to get the higher score. The game can be played with 1 other person or 1000,
it doesn't matter.
    HOW TO PLAY
In the real game, players would have 2 dice and a sheet of paper to keep score.
1. Player 1 rolls 2 dice, and adds that to his total
2. Now, the player can choose to end his turn or roll again (there is no limit to the number of rolls per turn)
3. If the player ends his turn, the next player will take theirs
4. If you keep rolling, and get a one, you lose all of your turn's points
5. If you keep rolling, and get 2 ones, you get snake eyes and lose all of your points
6. Keep doing this untill someone gets to 100 and wins
